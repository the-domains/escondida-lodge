  Playa Escondida offers a unique experience for the adventurous traveler. Three
  cabins accommodating up to four guests each are currently available, each with
  their own character and beauty. There is also a lodge on the beach, with an
  ocean view, open air and serene privacy. A private beach is only steps away,
  as the other two cabins are situated in the jungle. The Ocean Cabin has an
  outdoor shower and has a large balcony above the trees, with an amazing view
  of the ocean. The final cabin has two bedrooms and is also surrounded by lush
  gardens, with a greenhouse for long-term guests. Both are only a 5-minute walk
  from a private beach. All cabins are secluded retreats where one can enjoy and
  relax, with the sounds of the waves swooshing in the background. Guests are
  often visited by monkeys, Macaws, Parrots, Raccoons and other local fauna. The
  property is located about 15 minutes away from the Marine National Park, home
  of the famous whale tail. Mangrove kayaking, snorkeling, horseback riding, and
  surfing are all nearby activities which guests are also welcomed to enjoy.
